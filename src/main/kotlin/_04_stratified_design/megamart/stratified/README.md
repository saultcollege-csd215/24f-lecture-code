# Stratified Design

In this package, the code in the 'needsworks' package has been refactored to use stratified design. The code in the 'needsworks' package is not stratified and is not well designed. The code in the 'stratified' package is stratified and better designed.

Note that each layer that we identified using a call graph has been placed in its own package.  Although not necessary, 
this makes the layers more explicit in the code
